                    <h3>Bob Lomax</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have lived and worked in Central Florida since 1981. I've seen many changes in the air
                        conditioning business, some good and some not so good. It seems that the old adage "pride in
                        workmanship" was being lost to the bottom line and marketing and sales were driving the business
                        rather than customer service and quality. It is my belief that if you take care of the customer,
                        the bottom line will take care of itself. It is with this one simple idea that AirThere.com was
                        founded. AirThere.com offers personal low cost service and installations, where everything from
                        design and permits to sweeping up afterwards is done by the contractor. By working directly with
                        the homeowner we are able to cut overhead and still provide high quality workmanship by a master
                        technician.</p>
                    <p>Contracting the way it used to be, where completion means it "looks good, works good, and lasts a
                        long time" -- a job done right the first time.

                    <p class="card-text">We had heard good things about AirThere.com from friends, so we
                        called Bob Lomax. He
                        quickly came to our rescue, and the whole experience couldn't have been better. Bob
                        didn't try to sell us a new system nor issue dire warnings that required expensive but
                        unnecessary repairs. He had us cooled down within a couple of hours after our call. His
                        explanations made sense and we learned a lot about our system.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Prior to meeting Bob, my husband and I had two separate air conditioning
                        problems that nobody was able to fix. Along came Bob Lomax. In about an hour's time, he
                        had both problems
                        diagnosed and came back when he said he with the parts, as well as fixed both problems
                        for the price he
                        said it would cost. Bob is more than fair in his
                        pricing and his customer service. Yes, there still are some genuine people
                        out there</p>

                        everyone knows,
                        you canâ€™t live in Florida without your A/C. Our old A/C company finally came after 2
                        days. They took one
                        look at the unit for 30 seconds, and said we needed a new one without even touch the
                        equipment! We balked at this
                        since it unit was less than 6 years old. Bob was on vacation, but diagnosed the problem
                        over the phone.
                        He went out of his way to call a technician for us. The man showed up soon after and
                        repaired our A/C with a $30 part!</p>

                        services on my A/C. Everything from yearly check-ups to parts replacement to sales and
                        installation of a new system. Bob has always been patient and honest when explaining what needs
                        to be done and why it needs to be done. A well running A/C system is critical for living in
                        Florida. I would not trust the maintenance and care of this vital piece of equipment to
                        anyone else.</p>

                        anyone in the business. Especially when we realized our AC unit
                        have to be replaced. Fortunately, we had friends who happily
                        recommended Bob to us. With Bob, we felt at ease and were
                        delighted when his quote was substantially less than the others we received.
                        Not only did Bob fix us up with a great new system at a great
                        price, he was personable and trustworthy.</p>
