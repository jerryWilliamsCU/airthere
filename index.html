                    <h3>Bob Lomax</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have lived and worked in Central Florida since 1981. I've seen many changes in the air
                        conditioning business, some good and some not so good. It seems that the old adage "pride in
                        workmanship" was being lost to the bottom line and marketing and sales were driving the business
                        rather than customer service and quality. It is my belief that if you take care of the customer,
                        the bottom line will take care of itself. It is with this one simple idea that AirThere.com was
                        founded. AirThere.com offers personal low cost service and installations, where everything from
                        design and permits to sweeping up afterwards is done by the contractor. By working directly with
                        the homeowner we are able to cut overhead and still provide high quality workmanship by a master
                        technician. </p>
                    <p>Contracting the way it used to be, where completion means it "looks good, works good, and lasts a
                        long time." &mdash; a job done right the first time.</p>

                            better. Bob didn't try to sell us a new system nor issue dire warnings that required
                            expensive but unnecessary repairs. He had us cooled down within a couple of hours after our call. His

                            both problems for the price he said it would cost. Bob is more than fair in his

                            everyone knows, you canâ€™t live in Florida without your A/C. Our old A/C company finally came
                            after 2 days. They took one look at the unit for 30 seconds, and said we needed a new one without
                            even touch the equipment! We balked at this since it unit was less than 6 years old. Bob was on vacation,
                            but diagnosed the problem over the phone. He went out of his way to call a technician for us. The man showed up soon
                            after and repaired our A/C with a $30 part!</p>

                            to sales and installation of a new system. Bob has always been patient and honest when
                            explaining what needs to be done and why it needs to be done. A well running A/C system is critical for
                            living in Florida. I would not trust the maintenance and care of this vital piece of
                            equipment to

                            replaced. Fortunately, we had friends who happily recommended Bob to us. With Bob, we felt at ease 
                            and delighted when his quote was substantially less than the others we received.
                            Not only did Bob fix us up with a great new system at a great price, he was personable and trustworthy.</p>
